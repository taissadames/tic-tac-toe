# Tic Tac Toe
My first ever project! The classic tic-tac-toe game.

## :page_facing_up: About

- It's a tic tac toe game that you can play with your mate.
- It's pink :nail_care:
- Do you know a Paw Patrol fan? Do they love Skye and Everest? Then show them my awesome game.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

- Started taking manual notes when thinking of what approach I'd be using to build the game.
- Then I made a rough step-by-step on what variables and functions I would need.
- At first, I made a 3-rows and 3-columns chart, but then decided to turn them all into 9 buttons to add the click events.

## :rocket: Cool tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Some basic responsive design and media query adjustments for you to play in your phone too.

## :sob: Lessons learnt

- Keep it simple! 
- Start with the basic approach and then work your way to make it more sophisticated. Something I learnt after getting stuck and frustrated many times.
- Don't compare yourself with others. Each journey is unique! Be proud of what you've done and achieved.
- When I was stuck I would take a break and come back to work on my project with new inputs. 

## :white_check_mark: Future features

- I'd love to replace the 'X' and 'O' to some cool figurines.
- Add a scoreboard.
- Add sounds.
- Replace the background with a better quality image.
